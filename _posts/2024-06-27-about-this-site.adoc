A good tester to set up and configure a static site generator. Under the hood, here are the features:

* Jekyll (with the following plugins):
** GitHub pages, with GitHub Actions configured for easy deployment.
** jekyll-asciidoc, because I like asciidoc more than markdown.
** jekyll-compose, because the process of renaming and moving files is annoying.
** jekyll-archive, because Jekyll doesn't come with an OOTB way to browse posts by category.
