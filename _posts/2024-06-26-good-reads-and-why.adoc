I need somethiing I can quickly give to people when they ask for book recommendations. We all like different reasons, so I'll try to be clear about why a book was good for me. By the way, here's my {url-goodreads}[Goodreads].

I predominantly read non-fiction that contains actionable strategies, concepts or advice that I can take away when I'm done. Fiction is nice, too.

The list isn't sorted other than under the category it is in.
