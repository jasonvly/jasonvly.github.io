== What?

I do stuff. I obsess over the choices I make and how I can make better ones. You can see all the topics I write about over {url-topics}[here].

== Now?

A few things are going on at the moment:

* brushing up on general software development processes (compiling/configuring/installing/customising) through this site. 
* building mountain bikes and road bikes.
* training for triathlons in late July and late August.
* figuring out how I can balance my personal life and career goals. 
* taking time to write out all the ideas I like to live by, for me.
* assistant coaching a women's div 2 team at SVL.
* skipping out on boxing training (which I shouldn't be).
* fine tuning my 3D printer to try and get a good first layer.

If you have any insight or advice on anything above, feel free to link up with me and we can chat about it.
